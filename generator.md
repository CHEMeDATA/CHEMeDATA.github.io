## Format of the archive file
The obvious was to group a set of file including chemistry objects is to compressed or archive them in the form of a (typically) .zip file.
But better options.

- Use BagIt instead of simple .zip files to include additional information about date, checksum, etc.
- Apply [FITS analyser](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits) to identify file types.
- Complement FITS with a detector of [chemistry object](chemisty_object_detector.md)
