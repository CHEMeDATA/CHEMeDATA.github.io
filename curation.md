# curation tool
What a curation tool could do:
Allow authors of scientific articles, thesis, books, websites, *etc.* to complement the article (usually only a .pdf file) with data such as
- Chemistry stucture files (for searchability)
- NMR spectra
- etc.
Such a tool could be associated to any archive service such as Zenodo to store the data with proper linked-data for findability, *etc.*
# Contribution of the community
The same tool should allow anybody (properly looged in using (say) ORCHid) to review, correct, complement existing data records.
