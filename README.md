*Making chemistry data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).*

CHEMeDATA should become an umbrella organization combining efforts by diverse communities addressing the FAIRness and chemistry data in a similar and yet-to-be clearly defined manner. 

### Format for chemistry data

One of the activities of the CHEMeDATA Initiative is to encourage the development of new standards to report information extracted from crude data. For example, the [assignment of NMR spectra](https://nmredata.org/), IR spectra, etc. Extract some relevant information from the output of chemistry software, *etc.*)

Currently only the NMR community is a part of the CHEMeDATA Initiative via the [NMReDATA Initiative](https://nmredata.org/). Their main outcome is to associate the NMR assignment of an organic compound to a chemical structure file. This is done using so-called "tags" included in .sdf files, the latter being  compatible with the commonly used .mol format.

Potential developments:
- produce a format for the assignment of IR data in a form similar to the one of NMR (i.e. as TAGs in .sdf files reporting the assignment of a IR spectrum to the bonds of the structure)
- ... "please make comments via the "GitHub Issues" if you are interested to contribute or make comments.*

### How to make better chemistry data?

The supplementary data (typically .zip files) that are produced in association to publication or to fulfil the requirements of funding agencies to make data available can be improved.

- Recommendations for the [chemists](chemists.md).
- Recommendations and developments for the [providers](data_provider.md) of chemistry data (University repositories, Journal editors, etc.).
