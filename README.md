The core activity of the CHEMeDATA initiative is contribute to make chemistry data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## What do we mean by chemistry data?

- Spectra (IR, NMR, UV-Vis, etc.) as generated by the instruments or the software generating or manipulating them.
- Chemical structure files.
- the output of software (geometry optimization, simulation of chemical properties, etc.)
- etc.

We don't mean:
- the supplementary material of reaserach articles (usally pdf) associated with the main article on Journal publisher's web sites.
- the pdf of electronic scans of hard copies of the data.

## Format for data

One of the activity of the CHEMeDATA Initiative is to encourage the development of a standard to report information extracted from crude data (for example the assignment of NMR spectra, the assignment of IR spectra, the relevant information for output of chemistry software, etc.)

Running initiative: [NMReDATA.org](https//www.NMReDATA.org)

## How to make better chemistry data?

- Recommendations for the [chemists](chemists.md)
- Recommendations for the manufacturers of scientific instruments
- Recommendations for the providers of chemistry information
- Recommendations for the curator of chemistry information
- Recommendations for the developpers of standards in chemistry
