*Making chemistry data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).*

CHEMeDATA should become an umbrella organization combining efforts by diverse communities adressing FAIRness and chemistry data format in a simlar manner. 

### Format for chemistry data

One of the activities of the CHEMeDATA Initiative is to encourage the development of new standards to report information extracted from crude data (for example the assignment of NMR spectra, the assignment of IR spectra, the relevant information for output of chemistry software, *etc.*)

Currently only the NMR community is a part of the CHEMeDATA Initiative via the [NMReDATA Initiative](https://nmredata.org/). The main idea is to include NMR assignment data and links to NMR spectra to a molecule in the .sdf format (compatible with .mol format).

Potential developement:
- produce a format for the assignment of IR data in a form similar to the one of NMR (i.e. as TAGs in .sdf files reporting the assignment of a IR spectrum to the bonds of the structure)
- ... please make comments via the "Github Issues"

### How to make better chemistry data?

The supplementary data (typically .zip files) that are produced in association to publication or to fulfil the requirements of funding agencies to make data available can be improved.

- Recommendations for the [chemists](chemists.md).
- Recommendations for the [providers](data_provider.md) of chemistry data (University repositories, Journal editors, etc.).
