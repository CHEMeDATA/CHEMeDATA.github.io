The core activity of the CHEMeDATA initiative is contribute to make chemistry data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).



### Format for data

One of the activity of the CHEMeDATA Initiative is to encourage the development of a standard to report information extracted from crude data (for example the assignment of NMR spectra, the assignment of IR spectra, the relevant information for output of chemistry software, etc.)

Running initiative: [NMReDATA.org](https://nmredata.org/)

### How to make better chemistry data?

- Recommendations for the [chemists](chemists.md)
- Recommendations for the manufacturers of scientific instruments
- Recommendations for the [generator](generator.md) of chemistry information
- Recommendations for the [providers](data_provider.md) of standards in chemistry
