The core activity of the CHEMeDATA initiative is contributing to making chemistry data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

We consider it as an umbrella organization because it is expected to combine diverse efforts to aim at the same goals. 

### Format for chemistry data

One of the activities of the CHEMeDATA Initiative is to encourage the development of a standard to report information extracted from crude data (for example the assignment of NMR spectra, the assignment of IR spectra, the relevant information for output of chemistry software, etc.)

Currently only the NMR community is a part of the CHEMeDATA Initiative via the [NMReDATA Initiative](https://nmredata.org/).

Potential developement:
- produce a format for the assignment of IR data in a form similar to the one of NMR (i.e. as TAGs in .sdf files)
- ... please make comments via the "Github Issues"

### How to make better chemistry data?

We consider here the supplementary data (typically .zip files) that are produced in association to publication or to fulfil the requirements of funding agencies to make data open.

- Recommendations for the [chemists](chemists.md).
- Recommendations for the [providers](data_provider.md) of chemistry data (University repositories, Journal editors, etc.).
