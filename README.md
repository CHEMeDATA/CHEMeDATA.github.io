***How to make chemistry data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)?***

## Chemistry data

What do we mean by chemistry data?
- Spectra (IR, NMR, UV-Vis, etc.)
- Chemical structure files
- the output of software (geometry optimization, simulation of chemical properties, etc.)
- etc.

we don't mean:
- the supplementary material of reaserach articles (usally pdf) associated with the main article on Journal publisher's web sites)


## How to generate good chemical data

Requirement|type of data
----|-----
Must|Data as generated by the instruments or the software used to maniupulate them.
optional|add a pdf files generated by software.
to be avoided|scans /(pdf or images) of the hard copies of the data.

 * Should be provided only when no other data are available. In some favorable cases, data could be extracted from them, but it is difficult to generalize and incomplete.
