## Identify file types
- Apply [FITS analyser](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits) to identify file types.
- Complement FITS with a [detector of chemistry object (CO)](chemisty_object_detector.md)

## Format of the archive file
The obvious way to group a set of file including chemistry objects is to compressed or archive them in the form of a (typically) .zip file. This is what authors of scientific publication do when submitting supplementary data.

Better alternatives:
- Use BagIt instead of simple .zip files to include additional information about date, checksum, etc.


## Add a layer of open/FAIR data 
- For any file in a proprietary format add data in open format (or API to make them...and use visualize them ...).
-add smiles/inchi to chemistry ...
