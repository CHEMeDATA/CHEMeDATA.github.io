# Comments about the 6 key concepts

Two are "conceptuals":

- **Substance** is, formally, the "ideal" *Substance*, by its name, InChi, *etc.* Not an exemplification it the *Substance*.
- **Equation** is, formally, the "ideal" transformation of *Substances* into *Substances*.

The others are "real":

- **Sample**, is, formally, anything existing "stuff" we want to refer to. Typically refers to *Substances".
- **Process**, is, formaly, anything that transform a starting Sample into an ending Samples. It may refer to a chemical *Equation*.
- **Analytics**, is, formally, reporting information about a Sample.
- **Assignment** any higher level information about any of the above concepts (Another term may be more appropriate!)

## Relations between the Concepts

### Substance/Sample relation

A **Sample** is something that exist at a given time in time (in a flask, *etc.*). It includes *Substances* that are "conceptuals entity" such as glucose. Indeed, we clearly distinguish, a glucose solution and glucose, the abstract concept. The properties of glucose (as **Substance**) are, molecular formula, INCHI code, *etc.* The properties of a glucose sample are, mostly the name of the product (glucose) and concentration. Powdered glucose in a box is also considered as a **Sample** even if this word seems a bit unfortunate in this case - this is the disadvantage of any conceptualization - they may sound strange in some cases.

### Equation/Process relation

A chemical reaction taking place in a flask is a **Process**. It may be described by the "abstract" concept of "chemical equation" (**Equation**). For a process, we have a starting **Sample** and a final **Sample**.

### Analytics/Sample relation

Any analytical data (mass, NMR spectrum, *etc.*) report are **Analytics** and a about a **Sample**.
