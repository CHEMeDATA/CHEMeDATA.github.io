### Examples of extracted data

The list of carbon chemical shifts for a compound described in a paper

```json
CompoundWithNMRshift:{
	"reference": {
		"doi": "... doi of the source",
	},
	"extraction": {
		"... information about the method of extraction of the data (manual... software... author...)"
	},
	"compound":{
		"inchi": "inchi of the compound generated during extraction.",
		"inchiKey": "inchiKey of the compound generated during extraction. ?Needed?",
		"name": "the name of the compound used in the paper/thesis"
		},
	"NMRdata": {
		"nucleus": "1H",
		listChemicalShift : [23.3, 45.9]
	}
}
```

A schema of CompoundWithNMRshift will insure consistent format and content of the data. It could make the inchi or the solvent mandatory, but if a data extractor is not capable to fulfill the requirement, it could introduce a CompoundWithNMRshift_Light scheme that would not impose the requirement.
