*Making chemistry data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).*
Encourage (or require) the submission of all electronic data supporting the claims of the articles. This include spectroscopic information, spreadsheets of data, etc.

Help the Author to disthinguish the supplementary information which should be submitted as text (.pdf or .doc) files from the data which should be submitted in their native electronic forms.

Propose third-party archiving solution (such as Zenodo) if your server cannot accomodate the files submitted by the Authors. They offer solution of private links to give access to the reviewers only and embargo the repository until publication of the article.
### Instructions for the Authors
Images of NMR spectra, chemical structures, etc. can be included as pictures in a .pdf or .doc files when a they are discussed. But in all cases, they should be submitted in their native electronic format. 
For example, chemical structures should be submitted as .cdx, .mol, format.
For examples NMR spectra should be submitted in an electronic format (.mnova, zip of the Bruker files tree, etc.). Low-resolution images of 1D and 2D spectra pasted into are of very little use.
etc. - Include the crude/original data (chemdraw files, log files from commercial software, spreadsheets, spectra in the spectrometers format, pictures, etc.) in archive files.
These files should be ordered in a file arborescence to make their relations implict. For example, the chemical structure file and the  spectroscopid data of the compound numbered 1 in the article can be saved in a folder *compound1*.
