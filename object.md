In computer sciences, "object" are often data structure or a class.

For example a *spectrum* object may have properties
```
spectrum.axis      may refer to the values of the axis corresponding to the signal intensity of the spectrum (x coordinates of the points)
spectrum.data      may refer to the spectrum ( y coordinates of the points)
spectrum.instrumentManufacturer ...
spectrum.instrumentModel ...
spectrum.dateOfAcquisition
spectrum.operatorName
```
There is the idea that the spectrum is not just the data that may may be displayed of a human as a x/y plot, but that it may be accompanied with other relavant data (parameters, metadata, *etc.*)
