## How to generate good chemical data?

In most cases, you will be generating .zip files.

Requirement|type of data
----|-----
Must do|Save data as generated by the instruments or the software used to process them.
optional|Add a .pdf files generated by software.
To be avoided|Scans (pdf or images) of the hard copies of the data.

Scans of hard paper should be provided only when no other data are available. In some favorable cases, data could be extracted from .pdf generated by software, but it is difficult to generalize and imporant metadata and parameters will certainly be lost. 

If you caracterize compounds/samples using diverse methods, have all these data in the same compound folder so that the relation between structure and spectra is obvious. 

Schematically:

Don't group spectra by method (IR, NMR, *etc.*).
```
┬method1┬compound1
│       ├compound2
│       └compound3
└method1┬compound1
        ├compound2
        └compound4
```
Prefer to group them by compounds ...

... and include a structure file (the .cdx, .mol, .dsf, etc.):
```
┬compound1┬method1
│         ├method2 
│         └structure.mol (provide the structure file!)
├compound2┬method1
│         ├method2 
│         └structure.mol (provide the structure file!)
└compound3┬method1
          ├method2 
          └structure.mol (provide the structure file!)
```
The number following "compond" may correspond to the compound number in the publication/thesis. You may provide the common name instead of "compound".
