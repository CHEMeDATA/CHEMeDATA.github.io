## How to generate good chemical data?

In most cases, you will be generating .zip files.

Requirement|type of data
----|-----
Must do|Save data as generated by the instruments or the software used to process them.
optional|Add a .pdf files generated by software.
to be avoided|Scans (pdf or images) of the hard copies of the data.

Scans of hard paper should be provided only when no other data are available. In some favorable cases, data could be extracted from them, but it is difficult to generalize imporant data may be lost. 

If you caracterize compounds/samples using diverse methods, have all these data in the same compound folder so that the relation between structure and spectra is obvious. 

Schematically:

Don't group spectra by method (IR, NMR, *etc.*).
```
┬method1┬compound1
│       ├compound2
│       └compound3
└method1┬compound1
        ├compound2
        └compound4
```
Prefer by compounds and include the structure file:
```
┬compound1┬method1
│         ├method2 
│         └structure.mol (provide the structure file!)
├compound2┬method1
│         ├method2 
│         └structure.mol (provide the structure file!)
└compound3┬method1
          ├method2 
          └structure.mol (provide the structure file!)
```
Don't forget to provide the chemical structures of the compounds you provide data for (the .cdx, .mol, .dsf, etc.).

The compund number may correspond to the compound number if the publication/thesis.
