## How to generate good chemical data?

In most cases, you will be generating .zip files

Requirement|type of data
----|-----
Must do|Save data as generated by the instruments or the software used to maniupulate them.
optional|add a pdf files generated by software.
to be avoided|scans /(pdf or images) of the hard copies of the data.

Scans of hard paper should be provided only when no other data are available. In some favorable cases, data could be extracted from them, but it is difficult to generalize and incomplete. 

If you caracterize compounds/samples using diverse methods, move all these data in the same folder.
Don't forget to provide the chemical structures of the compounds you provide data for (the .cdx, .mol, .dsf, etc.)
