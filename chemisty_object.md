# Definition of "chemistry object"

There is no clear or autoritarian definition of a chemistry object (CO). 

In this context it refers to any piece of information relevant to chemistry. 
- the structure of a compound (drawing, .xcd file, flat representation or 3D representation, etc.)
- the output of a computer program of scientic instrument (spectrum, list of the energy of molecular orbitals, etc)
- the result of an experiment

The word [*object*](object.md) has a special meaning in computer sciences indicating that it has an electronic form meaning that it is computer understandable. A .jpg image of a spectrum, for example, cannot be understood by a computer to be a spectrum. It is an *image* object, not a chemistry or spectrum object. 

The formal definition of [Research Object](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/) (RO) has a lot of relevance. Parts of what should cover the definition of "chemistry object" may be part of the chemistry reaserch objects (CRO). 

Exactly what is common and different between the two concepts (CO *versus* CRO) has be studied in some detail to avoid misunderstanding.

## Key aspects

- Ability of humans to understand and determine the context of the occurance of the object
- Ability of a computer to identify the object and put it in relation to others objects or other relevant information (author, date of publication, etc.)

Eg. a hand-made drawing is not "readable" by a computer program.

## Relevance 

The (chemistry) objects carry information that can be seached for used by 
- humans to be learned, taught, cited, or used in other ways
- computers to be integrated into database, or any used in any type of processing.

Facilited the *use* is the key aspect of open and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data.
