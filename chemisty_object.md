# Definition of "chemistry object"

There is no clear or autoritatian definition of chemistry object. 

In this context it refers to any piece of information relevant to chemistry. 
- the structure of a compound (drawing, .xcd file, flat representation or 3D representation, etc.)
- the output of a computer program of scientic instrument (spectrum, list of the energy of molecular orbitals, etc)
- the result of an experiment

The word *object* has a [special meaning](object.md) in computer sciences indicating that it has an electronic form meaning that it is computer understandable. A .jpg image of a spectrum, for example, cannot be understood by a computer to be a spectrum. It is an *image* object, not a chemistry or spectrum object. 

## key aspects

Eg. a hand-made drawing is not "readable" by a computer program.

- humans to be learned, taught, cited, or used in other ways
