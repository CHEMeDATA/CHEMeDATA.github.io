# Definition of "chemistry object"

There is no clear or final definition of chemistry object. 

What we have in mind is broadly speaking any electronic piece of information relevant to chemistry. 
- the structure of a compound (drawing, .xcd file, flat representation or 3D representation, etc.)
- the output of a computer program of scientic instrument (spectrum, list of the energy of molecular orbitals, etc)
- the result of an experiment

## key aspects

- Ability of humans to understand and determine the context of the occurance of the object
- Ability of a computer to identify the object and put it in relation to others objects or other relevant information (author, date of publication, etc.)
Eg. a hand-made drawing is not "readable" by a computer program.

## Form of the object

- A sentence in a paper can express a chemistry oject (eg. "The mass of ... is ... g/mol)
